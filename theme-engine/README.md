# BubbleThemeEngine

Standalone Rust library and diagnostic CLI for generating BubbleOS semantic themes from local wallpapers.

## Build

Requires Rust 1.75 or newer.

```sh
cd theme-engine
cargo test --all-targets
cargo build --release
```

## Usage

```sh
cargo run --release -- generate \
  --wallpaper /path/to/wallpaper.jpg \
  --mode dark \
  --personality balanced \
  --output /tmp/bubble-theme.json
```

Without `--output`, the JSON document is written to stdout.

## Initial scope

- Local image analysis only; no network access or wallpaper upload.
- Bounded input file size, decoded dimensions and downsampled analysis.
- Deterministic five-cluster RGB analysis with chroma-aware subject selection.
- Semantic palette generation with balanced, vivid and muted accent personalities.
- Dark and light modes, balanced/vivid/muted palette personalities.
- WCAG contrast calculation and readable foreground selection.
- Versioned JSON output, independent of GTK, Qt and BubbleWM.

The first implementation intentionally does not watch wallpaper changes, manage preferences, run a daemon, or apply compositor effects. Those belong to later milestones.
